What is this?
====================================================================
A set of tools to aid in dealing with R's native C interface.  Think of this
as the next best thing to using Rcpp, but for pure C (and much less
comprehensive).

If you spend a lot of time in pure C or interfacing to other compiled
languages like Fortran, bringing C++ into the mix can be a recipe for 
headaches and disaster.  Also, C++ takes much longer to compile than C, 
so if you aren't really using the features of C++ (e.g., 
just wrapping existing compiled code for use with R), then this is
a needless way to slow down development time.  This can make the 
otherwise very handy Rcpp into somewhat of a burden.  This package 
tries to fill the "wrapper gap" for C programmers interfacing compiled 
code to R.

This package can be used much in the same way as Rcpp, though again, 
it is much less comprehensive.  At this point, Rcpp is an entire 
ecosystem of packages that make _writing_ compiled code for use with
R simpler.  This package is about _wrapping_ code for use with R.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley Wickham's
devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After installing that,
you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github(username="wrathematics", repo="SEXPtools")

into an R terminal to install this package.  See the manual and demos
for an explanation of usage.

The package vignette explains how to use SEXPtools and how to link
an R package with SEXPtools.  See SEXPtools/src/tests and SEXPtools/demo/ 
for example usage.  For example usage in real packages, see pbdBASE 
(especially), pbdDMAT, and memuse.
