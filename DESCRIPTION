Description: This package contains some useful simplifications for R's native 
        C interface. It can be used somewhat in the same way as Rcpp, though 
        it is much less comprehensive in scope and execution than Rcpp.  Rcpp 
        is an entire ecosystem of packages that make writing compiled code for 
        use with R simpler.  This package is meant for wrapping existing
        C/Fortran code for use with R.  Currently, the package is very young.  
        At this time, most of its utility is found in the SEXP printer, SEXP 
        allocation (and automatic gc counting), and the creation/management of 
        lists and dataframes.
