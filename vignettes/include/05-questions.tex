\section{Q\&A}

This section is a set of frequently asked questions (FAQ), with frequency uniformly
equal to zero.


\subsection{Why make this?}

Probably my biggest motivator was fun; I just wanted to make something like this.  Another,
more pragmatic reason is that part of my workload (for very non-standard reasons not worth 
getting into) prevents me from using \pkg{Rcpp}.  This leaves me stuck with the native \C\ 
interface for \R.  And I don't like \R's native \C\ interface.  This is my attempt to 
make that interface (slightly) more friendly and convenient to work with.


\subsection{Why the strange name?}

Every \R\ object (underneath, in the \C\ interface) is an \code{SEXP} (short for
S-expression) object, which is a struct pointer.  This is explained in the
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html#SEXPs}{R Internals} 
manual.  This package is a collection of tools for more easily managing SEXP 
objects.


\subsection{How does this differ from \pkg{Rcpp}?}
Each of these packages makes an attempt at solving a serious problem with utilizing compiled
code from \R: the native interface for \proglang{C} code in \R\ sucks.  There are huge 
differences between the two packages, however. In short, \pkg{Rcpp} is \emph{much} a much 
more comprehensive solution.  If you are new to using compiled code with \R, frankly this 
package probably is not for you; you would likely be much better served by \pkg{Rcpp}.  
However, if for some combination of reasons you either cannot or prefer to not use 
\pkg{Rcpp}, then this package may be of interest to you.

Beyond the scope and ease of use of each project (where \pkg{Rcpp} handily wins), there are
some other critical differences between the projects.  A few of note are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \thispackage\ is more permissively licensed than \pkg{Rcpp} (BSD rather than GPL)
  \item \thispackage\ is pure \C\, while \pkg{Rcpp} is \Cpp.
\end{enumerate}

These things may not matter in the least to you.  If that's the case, then you
may well be better served by \pkg{Rcpp}.


\subsection{Why would I want to use it?}

You may well not.  But it is an option available to you.


\subsection{How would I use \thispackage\ in a package?}

Assuming that you have some compiled code you have or want to create to use with a 
package, you simply link with \thispackage\ and then wrap that compiled code with 
the utilities provided by \thispackage.  For the former, see \secref{linking}, 
and for the latter, see \secref{specification} and \secref{example}.

Philosophically, you should never have the bulk of the work of a function (of any
importance) be handled by the \R\ interface (including \thispackage's version of it).
If you do, then your code can never (easily) have a life outside of \R.  That may sound fine to you
now, but if you ever decide to perform some of your work outside of \R, then you can't take
your compiled code with you.  This is just bad practice and shortsightedness.
